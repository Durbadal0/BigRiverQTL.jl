# BigRiverQTL.jl

`BigRiverQTL` is a comprehensive and user-friendly Julia package designed to facilitate transparent and interpretable quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. This package stands out for its modular approach, comprising three distinct components that streamline the complex process of QTL analysis. The first module, preprocessing, serves a dual purpose: it adeptly transforms genomic data into an accessible format that is both computationally efficient and memory-conservative while also calculating kinship matrices with ease. The second module tackles genomic scans, employing `BulkLMM` for rapid single-trait scans that outpace competing methods in computational speed. For multi-trait scans, `BigRiverQTL` uses `FlxQTL`, an innovative method capable of discerning intricate trait associations. Lastly, the third module offers robust plotting capabilities to visually represent genomic scan results, enhancing interpretability and facilitating insightful conclusions. Overall, `BigRiverQTL` exemplifies the synergy between advanced bioinformatics techniques and user-centric design, offering researchers an intuitive interface paired with powerful analytical tools for their QTL studies.
